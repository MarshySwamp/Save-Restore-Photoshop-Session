The scripts save and close all open files, logging their locations into a text file. Once you have finished with the unexpected task that interrupted the previous session, you can then run the second restore script to reopen all of the files from the previous session and continue. The active document from the previous session will be active when the docs are re-opened. Window sizes and positions, pan, zoom levels and other properties are not restored, the docs will simply re-open "as is".
